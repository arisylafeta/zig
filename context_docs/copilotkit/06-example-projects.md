## Key Learnings from Example Projects

### 1. Project Structure

Most CopilotKit projects follow a similar structure:

```
/
├── ui/                  # Frontend code
│   ├── app/             # Next.js app directory
│   ├── components/      # React components
│   ├── lib/             # Utility functions
│   └── public/          # Static assets
├── agent/               # Backend agent code
│   ├── src/             # Agent source code
│   └── index.ts         # Agent entry point
├── shared/              # Shared types and utilities
└── README.md            # Project documentation
```

### 2. Common Implementation Patterns

Across the example projects, several common patterns emerge:

1. **CopilotKit Provider Setup**:
   ```jsx
   import { CopilotKit } from "@copilotkit/react-core";
   
   function App({ children }) {
     return (
       <CopilotKit 
         runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit"
         agentName="your-agent-name"
       >
         {children}
       </CopilotKit>
     );
   }
   ```

2. **Chat Interface Integration**:
   ```jsx
   import { CopilotSidebar } from "@copilotkit/react-ui";
   
   function Layout({ children }) {
     return (
       <div className="layout">
         <CopilotSidebar />
         <main>{children}</main>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Context Provision**:
   ```jsx
   import { useCopilotReadable } from "@copilotkit/react-core";
   
   function DataComponent({ data }) {
     useCopilotReadable({
       description: "Application data",
       value: data
     }, [data]);
     
     return (/* component JSX */);
   }
   ```

4. **Action Definition**:
   ```jsx
   import { useCopilotAction } from "@copilotkit/react-core";
   
   function ActionComponent() {
     useCopilotAction({
       name: "performAction",
       description: "Performs an action in the application",
       parameters: [/* parameter definitions */],
       handler: (params) => {
         // Action implementation
       }
     });
     
     return (/* component JSX */);
   }
   ```

5. **Backend Integration**:
   ```typescript
   // pages/api/copilotkit.ts
   import { CopilotRuntime } from "@copilotkit/runtime";
   
   const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
     actions: ({ properties, url }) => [
       // Backend action definitions
     ],
     context: async ({ properties, url }) => {
       // Context data
     }
   });
   
   export default runtime.createHandler();
   ```

### 3. Adapting Examples for Your Use Case

When adapting these examples for your own projects:

1. **Start with the Right Template**: Choose the example project that most closely matches your use case
2. **Identify Core Components**: Understand the key components and how they interact
3. **Customize the UI**: Adapt the UI components to match your application's design
4. **Define Your Data Model**: Update the data structures to match your application's needs
5. **Implement Custom Actions**: Define actions specific to your application
6. **Configure Agents**: Set up agents with the appropriate capabilities
7. **Test and Iterate**: Test the integration and refine based on user feedback

## Conclusion

The example projects provided by CopilotKit demonstrate a wide range of AI-powered application patterns. By studying these examples and understanding their implementation details, you can accelerate the development of your own AI-enhanced applications.

For the Ebisu project, the "SaaS Dynamic Dashboards" and "Copilot Chat with Your Data" examples are particularly relevant, as they demonstrate how to build dynamic UIs that adapt to user needs and how to integrate chat functionality with application data.
