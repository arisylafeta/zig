      "text": "Is a bird without wings still a bird?\n\nThis question haunted me during Q3 2024 as I faced one of my toughest decisions yet.\n\nCheck out my previous posts for Q1 & Q2. Here's Q3:\n\nüåü JULY: The leap of faith\n\n‚ö´Ô∏è Dove into Harvard's CS50 - Looking behind the curtain of tech products was enlightening. After years of being just a tech user, I was shocked to realise these revolutionary products were just clever combinations of 0s and 1s. The first few weeks were tough, but learning felt great.\n‚ö´Ô∏è Made the journey more fun - Working for myself meant true autonomy. With just a laptop and WiFi, I turned parks, art galleries, coffee shops, and libraries into my office. My imagination became my only limit.\n‚ö´Ô∏è Runway Extension - Made the tough decision to move back home. As a young adult who'd spread their wings, returning to the nest felt like having them clipped. Is a bird without wings still a bird?\n‚ö´Ô∏è Hit my second consecutive 100km running month (101.7 km in 10+ hours)\n\nüöÄ AUGUST: No wings required\n\n‚ö´Ô∏è Moving home transformed my life - Reconnecting with my parents awakened dormant parts of me. Without the weight of survival, I began to thrive. A full fridge and clear mind put me in a state of play.\n‚ö´Ô∏è Found my North Star - Discovered Pieter Levels, whose lifestyle and approach to building became my blueprint for the future.\n‚ö´Ô∏è Leveled Up - Completed Harvard's CS50, building Sands as my final project - an app helping people live more intentionally through visual time management.\n‚ö´Ô∏è Reality Check - The course was just the beginning. Building production-ready applications would require much more than CS50 could offer. Time to dive deeper.\n‚ö´Ô∏è Kept moving - Completed 20 runs, covering 107.6km in just under 10 hours.\n\n‚ö° SEPTEMBER: You have a plan until you get punched in the face\n\n‚ö´Ô∏è Ambitious Plans - I wanted to learn how to build production-ready applications, and I wanted to do it as fast as possible. I set a challenge for myself: clone and build 30 major tech company's product in 30 days. Looking back, my optimism was both admirable and hilariously wrong.\n‚ö´Ô∏è First Real Build - My first production-ready app was Creatorr. It generated conversations, code, music, images, and videos using OpenAI and Replicate APIs. I started the app on 4th September, and it took me 15 days to complete. One app down, twenty-nine to go... or so I thought.\n‚ö´Ô∏è Body's Reality Check - A football injury turned into a cascade of problems when I rushed back too soon. I ran 65km in a week and I destroyed my legs. By the end of the week, my left ankle, knee and shin felt like lead; it felt so brittle that any pressure would easily snap the bone. I struggled to walk and was homebound for four days.\n\n---\nüëãüèª I‚Äôm a Founder in London building my startups, and sharing my journey & learnings along the way so others can do the same.\n\nFollow for startup secrets & resources!\n\nFull post on my Substack (2024 wrapped - living on mercury)\n\n#Entrepreneurship #startup",

      "text": "The quarter that shattered plans, perspectives, and limitations. Here's the Executive Summary of Q2 2024.\n\nApril: Customer Discovery üéØ\n\n‚ö´Ô∏è After 40+ customer interviews, I developed a Proof-of-Concept of my app using no-code tools. I realised I needed serious technical muscle to take it further as I needed to process 1000s of datapoints.\n‚ö´Ô∏è Met two founders working on a similar idea, and we decided to join forces.\n‚ö´Ô∏è I went on 17 runs, accumulated 110.5 km and spent 11:29:00 hours running.\n\nMay: The Adjustment ‚ö°Ô∏è\n\n‚ö´Ô∏è I hoped working with two additional individuals would triple the productivity. Instead, it divided it by three.\n‚ö´Ô∏è On 10th May, in our morning meeting, I highlighted my concerns and decided to part ways. I couldn't wait for 'things to click'. I have been in many co-founding relationships, and when I observe red flags, I don't wait for things to go wrong.\n‚ö´Ô∏è After the co-founder breakup, I was on my own again. There is no other way to say it ‚Äî I felt shit. \n‚ö´Ô∏è I switched gears. I set the goal of developing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) myself.\n‚ö´Ô∏è On 20th May at 8:20pm, I opened Visual Studio Code for the first time. By 4:07 am, I'd written my first bit of Python code. Watching my code process data changed me. I realised what I thought was my global maximum was just my local maximum.\n‚ö´Ô∏è My running really took a hit from the co-founder breakup. By 14th May, I only ran 25.34 km. I returned on the 23rd and tried to recuperate as much as possible. I ran 40 km that week, bringing my total to 65.34 km.\n\nJune: My Love-Hate Affair with GPT üíªüíî\n\n‚ö´Ô∏è Back on track: 16 runs, 100 km, 10:27:21 hours running.\n‚ö´Ô∏è I spent the first half of June talking to OpenAI's GPT. I'd tell GPT what I wanted, get the code, put it into VS code, test it out, and then repeat‚Äîover and over and over and over again. I pulled a few all-nighters doing this. There was something so addicting about it.\n‚ö´Ô∏è While I was making progress, this experience was extremely frustrating. GPT isn't perfect, and bits of code were deleted whenever I asked for revisions.\nIt got so frustrating that I started giving GPT prompts in caps locks. \"FIX THIS PLS\"; \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?\"; \"YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME\". I don't know what I hoped to achieve with this because I was talking to a robot, but I was running out of options.\n‚ö´Ô∏è By the end of June, I snapped. I needed to readjust my approach because I didn't want to be #1 on GPT's kill list once AI took over and I'd probably lose my sanity before GPT got to that stage. I needed to stop being a mindless monkey and understand what the code was doing. \n‚ö´Ô∏è I started Harvard University's CS50‚ÄîIntroduction to Computer Science course to achieve this.\n\nüî• Part 3 coming on Monday: Follow to stay updated!\n\nWant the full story?

Many of the Founders in my network had no idea how to grow and scale their businesses, so I thought my services could bring them value.\n‚ö™Ô∏è I went on 17 runs, covered 92.79 km and spent 9:26:30 hours running.\n\nFebruary: Planning & Building üõ†Ô∏è\n\n‚ö´Ô∏è I built the Sales Automation Agency; I decided to call it Outbound Hero. I know LinkedIn like the back of my hand, and with this knowledge, I helped a few pre-seed and seed-stage companies develop their Sales and Go-to-Market strategies. I laid the foundations for market entry into their designated verticals.\n‚ö´Ô∏è Continued applying for jobs. I started to get interviews, but the positions could have been more desirable. I did the interviews anyway.\n‚ö´Ô∏è I went on 13 runs, covered 96.29 km and spent 9:10:48 hours running.\n\nMarch: Plot Twist üîÑ\n\nüü£ Continued applying for jobs. The count was up to 250+ applications at this point. I began to despise ATS systems and just the general hiring process. I got tired of constantly having to sell myself.\nüü£ Sunset Outbound Hero. Learning: I enjoyed working with Founders, but the agency model was unscalable. It required more face time than I had anticipated. My clients (pre-seed/seed stage startups) wanted my help, but they couldn't afford my services.\nüü£ I got hit by a car near Waterloo as I was cycling. I was fine. I had minor injuries, but my bike can't say the same. I want to say that my life flashed before my eyes, but it didn't. The only flash was that of a blue BMW. Learning: Life can end in an instant, be grateful for each moment.\nüü£ I went on 15 runs, hit 100.6 km, and spent 8:42:18 hours running.\nüü£ I went back to the drawing board to generate software ideas. After Outbound Hero, I wanted to build a pure SaaS business. I started to generate a few ideas.\nüü£ I entered my first AI Hackathon (Hosted by Encode) and won.\n\nüî• Part 2 coming on Thursday\nü™ê Detailed breakdown: https://lnkd.in/eJMmfdm2",

      "text": "What if entrepreneurs had their own Spotify Wrapped? Here's mine for 2024 üëá\n\nHey LinkedIn üëãüèª\nIt's been 7 months since my last post, and A LOT has happened since then.\nI thought of the best way to catch you up on all the material updates, and then I thought of Spotify.\n\nEvery year, Spotify transforms our listening habits into beautifully digestible stories through its Wrapped campaign. I love how they turn raw data into meaningful narratives.\n\nI decided to do the same for my year as an Entrepreneur.\nüéÅ Introducing the world's first Wrapped - Entrepreneur's Edition üéÅ\n\nWhat's inside:\n\nBuilding üõ†Ô∏è\nüßëüèª‚Äçüíª Apps developed\nüíª Tech stack evolution\nüß† Skills gained & outputs delivered\n\nGrowth üìà\nü§ù Relationships built\nü´Ä Health & fitness journey\nüêâ Character development & challenges faced\n\nInvestment ‚è≥\nTotal time invested in the entrepreneurial journey\n\nSwipe to see my 2024 wrapped in raw numbers - including the highs, lows, and everything in between! üìä\n\n--\n\n‚ÑπÔ∏è About Entrepreneur Wrapped ‚ÑπÔ∏è \n\nWhy hasn't it been done before?\n\n1. It's hard to track and analyse metrics across all the activities you do as an Entrepreneur\n2. It's hard to be honest and authentic about the trials and tribulations you face along the way\n3. It's hard to show the world who you are \n\nWhy did I do 2024 Wrapped?\n\nPersonal reasons:\n1. Management guru Peter Drucker says, \"What gets measured gets managed\". If you want to improve something, you need to measure it.¬†This year's data gives me a baseline. Next year, I work harder, and I work smarter.\n\n2. Everything has a price. I consider this Wrapped as my receipt for this year as an Entrepreneur. The time I invested and what I went through is the price I'm paying to get what I want. By tracking this year-on-year (YoY), I can track the accurate price of Entrepreneurship.\n\nSocial reason:\nTo bridge the gap between expectations and reality by sharing authentic entrepreneurial experiences. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang said the pain and suffering he experienced starting the chip giant would be enough to put him off ever doing it again. I understand his perspective because this year, I lived on Mercury. I didn't expect this, but the pain and suffering was real. I hope this Wrapped (and all future content):\n\n1. Inspires entrepreneurs to share their journeys authentically; \n2. Educates and informs aspiring entrepreneurs about the journey they are about to embark on.\n\nWant to dive deeper into what living on Mercury really means?\nI wrote about my journey in 2024 on Substack: https://lnkd.in/d3rhJpUf\n\n--\nHave a Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year! üéâ",

      "text": "What do you need to know to start a startup? ü§î\n\nStarting a startup is no joke.\n\nIt‚Äôs a long, tough journey and most of the startup‚Äôs value will come after 10+ years. The graph below shows market capitalisation over time (Chart by James Currier at Nfx).\n\nTherefore, if you‚Äôre in it for the long run, you should prepare adequately for the journey.\n\nImagine you are preparing to run a marathon - yes, you could show up on the day without any training or nutritional plan and grind through it, but you‚Äôll¬†probably have a terrible time doing it (and it won‚Äôt be fun).\n\nStartups are the same.\n\nOver the next few weeks, I‚Äôll share some of the ways I've prepared for this journey.\n\nI appreciate we learn differently. Therefore, in the spirit of inclusivity, I'll share content that can be consumed via text, audio and video.\n\nToday, it is about text. üìù\n\nThese are a few of the books I‚Äôd recommend reading and one key insight I learnt from them.\n\nüìö Zero to One (Peter Theil) - Don‚Äôt compete, aim to be a monopoly. \n\nIf you have an undifferentiated product, you will always be battling your competition, and war is bad for business. This market state is great for the consumer, but not so great for the producer (startup) as your profits will get competed away. No profits = no way to reinvest and improve your product.\n\nüìö Start with why (Simon Sinek) - Start with why. \n\nPeople don‚Äôt buy what you do, people buy why you do it. History is littered with stories of people who have strived towards the same goal, but some succeed and others don‚Äôt. I love the example of the Wright brothers inventing the¬†airplane. There was competition from a better-funded team led by Samuel Pierpont Langley, but we all know who won that race.\n\nüìöThe code of an extraordinary mind (Vishen Lakhiani) - You get to pick the rules. \n\nWe¬†aren‚Äôt asked¬†to be born into this world, and when we are, we keep getting told things should be the way they are because of 'X' or 'Y' reasons. Vishen says these are ‚ÄòBrules‚Äô. You have the autonomy to choose, and you should pick the rules that work best with the type of life you want to live.\n\nLet me know if this was helpful and drop some of your favourite books in the comments section below ‚¨áÔ∏è\n\nP.S Bonus content: A summary PDF of The Code of an Extraordinary Mind here -https://lnkd.in/dbMmwZG4\n\n#sharingiscaring #socialcapital",

This marks a small decline from its peak of $603.3bn in 2018. \n\n2. Enterprise-dedicated platforms are in vogue as investors see a more clear path to profitability in this sector.\n\n3. There has been growing participation of nontraditional VCs. These nontraditional and foreign players seek exposure to fast-growing tech-companies in order to diversify their own portfolios. \n\n4. 2019 so far has been the year of record exit values. 14 exits which include $15.3bn in acquisitions of unicorns and $142bn in IPO value. This could be the start of a trend where you see cash-rich tech giants acquire these unicorns more actively. \n\n#trend #vcs #unicorns",
